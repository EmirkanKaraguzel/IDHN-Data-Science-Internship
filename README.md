# IDHN-Data-Science-Internship
Text extraction from images and classification using neural network with Python.

During this internship I have been immersed in a world that every data scientist would dream of inside the computer science section of the research laboratory the IDHN. I worked there as a data scientist and was responsible for researching text recognition and floor plans.

So far, if you search for similar projects around floor-plan analysis on the internet you won’t find explicit data set about each room and moreover you won’t find a text recognition program that will work efficiently for this same purpose. My main objectives were to generate a script that will be able to read, extract and create a database based on the plans I provide to it. With this new data-set, I performed some research and predictions around house pricing using my own generated data-set. Using tools such as data visualization, deep and machine learning models with Python.
